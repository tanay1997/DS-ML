Data Science and ML Projects

1) Text Classification: Built a Naive Bayes Classification Model from scratch for Text Classification. The Classify and train functions can be modified / generalised to train and classify any Input Data.

2) Image Generation with Deep Learning: Variational Autoencoder for generating new face images.

3) Image Data Classification with Restricted Boltzmann Machine: RBM employed to obtain latent image features further used for classification.

4) E-M Algorithm.
